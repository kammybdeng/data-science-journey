### Statistical Concepts (in progress)
Statistics is used to make inferences from our subset of data. Commonly used tools are: StatsModels

### Probability Modelings (in progress)
Probability is the fundamentals of statistics. It looks into the reasoning and behavior of the distributions and justifies our use of statistical methods .

### Python Challenges (in progress)
Python is essential for feature engineering and data manipulation. Common libraries are: pandas, numpy, and seaborn

### Database and SQL (in progress)
Data Scientists interact with database systems everyday. They need to extract relevant datasets by writing SQL queries.
