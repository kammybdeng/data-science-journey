This repository is mainly used as my own reference for interview preparation. However, if you find it helpful and interesting, feel free to contact me on LinkedIn for any questions or comments!

You can build a wordcloud too! See my code [here](https://github.com/kammybdeng/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/extra/wordcloud.py).

## Data Science Concepts

### Data Science Concepts (in progress)
Practical business concepts of data problems.

[Data Science Concepts](https://github.com/kammybdeng/data-science-notes/blob/master/general_notes/Data_Science_notes.ipynb)

### Statistical Concepts (in progress)
Statistics is often used to generate inference hypothesis in our data.

[Statistical Concepts](https://github.com/kammybdeng/dsi-interview-prep/blob/master/Stats%20Concepts.ipynb)

### Probability Modelings (in progress)
Probability is the fundamentals of Statistics. By understanding the behavior of the data distributions, we can justify our methods of statistical analysis.

## Database and SQL

### Database and SQL (in progress)
Data Scientists often interact with SQL and other database systems.

- [Database](https://github.com/kammybdeng/data-science-notes/blob/master/database-explained.ipynb)
- [SQL Exercises](https://github.com/kammybdeng/data-science-notes/blob/master/sql_exercises.ipynb)



## Take home and python exercises

### Take home (in progress)
A repository consists of take home exercises from the book, "A collection of Data Science Take-homes."

[Take home repository](https://github.com/kammybdeng/take-home-practices)

### Python Challenges (in progress)
Python is essential for feature engineering and data manipulation.
