This repository is for my own reference to prepare for interviews and write-ups for future articles. It contains my general notes and insights of Data Science.

You can build a wordcloud too! See my code [here](https://github.com/kammybdeng/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/extra/wordcloud.py).

### Data Science Concepts (in progress)
More practical concepts that perceives the problem from a business perspective

[Data Science Concepts](https://github.com/kammybdeng/data-science-notes/blob/master/general_notes/Data_Science_notes.ipynb)

### Statistical Concepts (in progress)
Statistics is used to make inferences from our subset of data. Commonly used tools are: StatsModels

[Statistical Concepts](https://github.com/kammybdeng/dsi-interview-prep/blob/master/Stats%20Concepts.ipynb)

### Probability Modelings (in progress)
Probability is the fundamentals of statistics. It looks into the reasoning and behavior of the distributions and justifies our use of statistical methods .

## Database and SQL

### Database and SQL (in progress)
Data Scientists interact with database systems everyday. They need to extract relevant datasets by writing SQL queries.

## Take home and python exercises

### Take home (in progress)

[Take home repository](https://github.com/kammybdeng/take-home-practices)

### Python Challenges (in progress)
Python is essential for feature engineering and data manipulation. Common libraries are: pandas, numpy, and seaborn
