# Data Science Journey

This repository is mainly for myself to prepare for interviews and write-ups for future articles.

## Definition

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured, similar to data mining
(Source: Wikipedia)

## Applications

Some examples are:

  - Fraud Detection
  - User Growth
  - Product performances


## Steps of implementation


  ### 1.  Data Collection
  Knowing what kind of data to pull from the data warehouse that would solve the problem

  ### 2. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
  Explore the date to gain general idea of the data

  ### 3. Data Cleaning/Transform
  Clean and filter data to obtain information that are needed

  ### 4. Feature Engineering
  Transforming data into meaningful information that can be put into a model

  ### 5. Model Selection
  Select a relevant model for the problem (this phase often involves industrial or domain knowledge of the business)

  ### 6. Model Training
  Train the model to have the best performances

  ### 7. A/B Testing
  Common methods to validate the model in practice would be performing A/B testing

  ### 8. Evaluation
  Since the data collected from the A/B tests and(or) the original data only represents a subset of the population, we can use statistics to make inferences to reject of fail to reject our hypothesis

  ### 9. Actionable deliverables
  After the technical and real life practical results and conclusions, we can now put the actionable deliverables into action.



It contains general data science notes and some of my insights on data science.

### Data Science Notes (in progress)
More practical concepts that perceives the problem from a business perspective

### Statistical Concepts (in progress)
Statistics is used to make inferences from our subset of data. Commonly used tools are: StatsModels

### Probability Modelings (in progress)
Probability is the fundamentals of statistics. It looks into the reasoning and behavior of the distributions and justifies our use of statistical methods .

### Python Challenges (in progress)
Python is essential for feature engineering and data manipulation. Commonly used tools are: pandas, numpy, and seaborn

### Machine Learning Notes
Any kind of models that can learn from the input data and output predictions.
