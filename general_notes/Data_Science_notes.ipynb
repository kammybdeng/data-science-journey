    "4. **Feature Engineering**: Transforming data into meaningful information that can be put into a model\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model Selection**: Select a relevant model for the problem (this phase often involves industrial or domain knowledge of the business)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Model Training**: Train the model to have the best performances\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **A/B Testing**: Common methods to validate the model in practice would be performing A/B testing\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Evaluation**: Since the data collected from the A/B tests and(or) the original data only represents a subset of the population, we can use statistics to make inferences to reject of fail to reject our hypothesis\n",

    "9. **Actionable deliverables**: After the technical and real life practical results and conclusions, we can now put the actionable deliverables into action.\n"
